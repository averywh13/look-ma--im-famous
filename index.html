          <p class="card-text text-white col-8">Leonardo da Vinci, born 1452 and passed 1519, was an Italian influence of the Renaissance period, known for his findings in various fields such painting, inventing, scientific, and many more. His talents and contributions have made him one of the most iconic figures in the history of art. Da Vinci's legacy lives not only through his completed works of art but in his numerous sketches and writings that give insight into his creative processes and intellectual pursuits. His ability to integrate artistic expression with scientific inquiry has left a superficial mark on the history of human achievement.</p>

          <p class="card-text text-white">As an artist, Leonardo da Vinci has had many artistic accomplishments, however his most famous is the "Mona Lisa." Her original name is "La Gioconda" in Italian or "La Joconde" in French. The Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 and is now located in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. It is displayed behind bulletproof glass and has been up since the French Revolution. Da Vinci's art technique was composed of sfumato, a blurring or softening of the edges, and chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow to create it. However the most well known concept of the Mona Lisa is her smile. Her smile seems to change depending on the viewer's perspective. In 1911, the Mona Lisa was stolen and renamed the Louvre by an Italian named Vincenzo Peruggia. It was then recovered in 1914 and its theft has made it increase in fame.</p>

          <h1 class="card-title text-white">AS AN INVENTOR</h1>
          <p class="card-text text-white">As an inventor, da Vinci created many inventions one being the water wheel.n The water wheel was a part of the broader interest in engineering, mechanics, and hydraulics. It was commonly used during the Renaissance period to harness the power of flowing water for various uses, such as milling grain, sawing wood, and pumping water. He incorporated a screw mechanism to enhance the efficiency of the water wheel. The mechanism would adjust the angle of the blades, allowing the water wheel to better adapt to the flow of water and maximize its power. Da Vinci was highly interested in hydraulic engineering and water-related projects. This ultimately led to his creation of the water wheel. However, many of da Vinci's were not constructed, they only remained on paper as sketches and conceptual ideas.</p>

          <h1 class="card-title text-white">AS A SCIENTIST</h1>
          <p class="card-text text-white">As a scientist, da Vinci made many contributions to science with his muscle studies. He explored the mechanics of muscles and their role in movement. His studies went beyond observation, which attempted to understand the underlying principles of muscle function and the mechanics of the human body. He observed the attachments of muscles to bones and how they worked in tandem to produce movements. He documented the structure of muscles, tendons, and ligaments, which provided an understanding of the anatomy in various movements. He also studied the contraction of muscles. They work based off of contracting and relaxing and made detailed sketches depending the arrangement of muscle fibers. He further explored the mechanics of joints, ligaments and tendons, nervous system and muscle control, and the muscle groups and functions. </p>
